    I briefly looked into the history of Syuri and Konami leading to their match at the Nippon Budokan on March 3 2021 previously, which you can find on <a href="https://twitter.com/CanofSpriteMan/status/1362344225682161666">Twitter</a>.

<p>
    At it's core, the theme of the rivalry between Syuri and Konami been about finding out what strength is and the steps needed to attain it. This was first displayed in their encounter in early 2021, where Konami challenged Syuri for the SWA World Championship at the Nippon Budokan. Konami sought to test whether she had surpassed her master and the wrestler she viewed as the "ideal wrestler". However, she would go on to lose this match to Syuri, proving that she had not yet surpassed her master and had not reached the level of strength she was aspiring for.

<p>
    In late 2021, Syuri began her campaign to challenge for the World of Stardom Championship, held by her rival Utami Hayashishita, after she won the 2021 5STAR Grand Prix by defeating Momo Watanabe in the finals. On the road to her title match at Ryogoku Kokugikan on December 29, 2021, Syuri took on the challenge of defending her World of Stardom Championship Challenge Contract against opponents who had defeated her during the 5STAR.
</p>
<p>
    One of the opponents who defeated her in the 5STAR was Konami. Their match was scheduled for October 9, 2021, at Osaka-jo Hall. Both Syuri’s contract and her SWA World Championship were on the line and was to be contested under UWF rules, which paid homage to their shared background in mixed martial arts while serving as a proving ground for Konami to demonstrate whether the gap between student and master had finally narrowed. Unfortunately, the match had to be postponed when Konami was forced to withdraw due to acute enteritis. She was replaced by her Oedo Tai comrade, Saki Kashima, who ultimately lost to Syuri. After her win, Syuri expressed her determination to eventually face Konami in the ring.

<p>
    The long-awaited match between the two was rescheduled for November 27, 2021, at Yoyogi National Gymnasium #2. In a high impact contest, which started off with Konami getting the upper-hand, Syuri eventually emerged victorious after delivering a decisive Buzzsaw Kick that knocked Konami out. Following the match, the two exchanged gestures of respect, reaffirming their relationship as student and master and that the gap between them was still too large.
</p>
<p>
    Shortly after, on December 4, 2021, Konami announced her decision to leave Stardom at the end of the year to focus on treating her health issues. She revealed in <a href="https://wp.bbm-mobile.com/sp2/EBook/Detail.asp?mi=1678">Weekly Pro Wrestling</a> that she had been dealing with acute enteritis for two years, with flare-ups requiring hospitalization each time. This decision to leave had been made before her originally scheduled match with Syuri on October 9, and she had told both Syuri and Stardom that same day. Her final match was set for December 29, 2021, at Ryogoku Kokugikan against Giulia who had become a close friend to Konami and Syuri over the years.
</p>
<p>
    In the weeks leading up to her farewell match, Konami wrapped up her remaining commitments. She played a key role in helping Oedo Tai recruit Momo Watanabe from Queen’s Quest, teamed with Fukigen Death one final time before transferring ownership of Fukigen to Saki Kashima, and partnered with Syuri for a final tag team match against Maika and Unagi Sayaka —both of whom had sought a match with Konami before she left.

<p>
    On December 29, 2021, at Ryogoku Kokugikan, Konami wrestled her farewell match against Giulia. For this special occasion, she shed Oedo Tai's colors and donned the colors of Tokyo Cyber Squad, the unit founded by her late friend Hana Kimura. The match paid tribute to TCS, featuring callbacks to signature moves of both Hana Kimura and Jungle Kyona, another prominent member of Tokyo Cyber Squad. After the match, Konami was presented with a commemorative flag marked with a variation of her catchphrase: “NEVER END,” a hopeful twist on “THE END”, and also featured many messages from the roster wishing her well in her departure. This gesture symbolized that while Konami was stepping away, her journey in wrestling was not over.
</p>
<p>
    Later that evening, Syuri faced Utami Hayashishita in their long-anticipated showdown for the World of Stardom Championship, with the SWA World Championship also on the line. Konami served as the guest commentator for the match and witnessed Syuri’s hard-fought victory. After the match, Syuri met with Konami at the commentary table and they shared an embrace to celebrate while also allowing Konami to express her hope that Syuri would retain the title until Konami’s eventual full time return to the ring.

    <span class="image-caption">Syuri announcing her departure from Donna Del Mondo</span>
</div>
<p>
    On March 21 2022, three months after winning the World of Stardom Championship, Syuri announced her departure from Donna Del Mondo, the unit she had been with since her debut. She expressed her desire to forge her own path and that she would be hiring a bodyguard to join her in that path. This bodyguard was unveiled on March 26 2022, following Syuri's successful defence of the Red Belt against Giulia, when she introduced Ami Sohrei as her new bodyguard and the first member of her new unit, God’s Eye.
</p>
<p>
    The name God’s Eye was chosen to symbolize their belief that they were chosen by the God of Fighting. Their goal was to surpass their own limitations and become stronger than they were previously, which is reflected by their motto “Don’t lose to yourself, go beyond your limits.”
</p>
<p>
    On April 3, 2022, God’s Eye grew stronger with the addition of MIRAI, a former Donna Del Mondo member who believed in Syuri's vision and wanted to train under her guidance. On April 17, 2022, Syuri revealed that they would be also bringing in the “strongest bodyguard”, who was none other than Konami, and that she would make a limited return to Stardom during Golden Week as part of God’s Eye.
</p>
<div class="article-image left landscape" >

    <span class="image-caption">Konami passing on the moniker of the "Fighting Princess" to MIRAI</span>
</div>
<p>
    During her absence from Stardom, Konami returned to her hometown of Fukuyama where she resumed her training under MMA legend Megumi Fujii. Fujii, who was a pivotal figure in shaping Konami’s wrestling style, now played a crucial role in helping her refine her technique and rebuild the strength necessary for her eventual return to wrestling.
</p>
<p>
    Konami’s return during Golden Week highlighted the strength of God’s Eye, as they went undefeated, including a victory over Oedo Tai, Konami’s former unit. Konami would recognize the strength of the group’s newer recruits, so much so that she would pass on her former moniker, "The Fighting Princess," to MIRAI, who embraced the title as "The New Fighting Princess."
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, by the end of 2022, Syuri would lose the World of Stardom Championship to Giulia marking the end of her dominant reign during which she had overcome formidable challengers, including Mayu Iwatani, Risa Sera, Momo Watanabe, Tam Nakano, Nanae Takahashi, and a rematch with former World of Stardom Champion Utami Hayashishita.
</p>

    <span class="image-caption">MIRAI and Ami Sohrei as the Wonder of Stardom and Future of Stardom champions respectively</span>
</div>
<p>
    Despite Syuri's title loss, 2022 and 2023 continued to be statement years for God’s Eye, with its members achieving significant milestones both individually and as a team. MIRAI claimed back-to-back victories in the Cinderella Tournament and captured the Wonder of Stardom Championship from Tam Nakano while Ami Sohrei defeated Hanan for the Future of Stardom Championship. Together, the duo also were able to win the Goddesses of Stardom Championships from Nanae Takahashi and Yuu, which helped further cement God's Eye's presence as a dominant force in Stardom.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, Konami continued to make sporadic appearances in Stardom during this period, including another match against Syuri which served as a test on whether Syuri still possessed the strength she demonstrated during her reign as World of Stardom Champion, as she prepared for her match with Chihiro Hashimoto. Syuri would win this match against Konami, proving her strength, before going on to defeat Chihiro Hashimoto by knockout on April 23 2023 in Yokohama Arena.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Defining Strength: The Journey vs The Destination</h2>

    <img src="/kvs2024/20230702-600x400.jpg" alt="Saki Kashima joining God's Eye" width="100%" />
    <span class="image-caption">Saki Kashima joining God's Eye after defending her High Speed Championship</span>
</div>
<p>
    In the summer of 2023, the biggest change in God’s Eye would occur when Saki Kashima joined the group after being expelled from Oedo Tai following their loss in a Loser Leaves Their Unit Steel Cage match against Queen’s Quest. Unlike the other members of God’s Eye, Saki had no interest in training. Instead, she sought to use God’s Eye as a shield, hoping to protect herself from the rest of the roster and allow her to slack off which was reflected by her attempts to skip practice and avoid participating in matches. While the rest of God’s Eye adapted to accept and integrate Saki into the group, Konami found it difficult to accept her presence as she recognized that Saki had not changed her ways since their time together in Oedo Tai and felt that she would be a detriment to the group.
</p>
<p>
    Konami teamed with God's Eye and Saki for the first time on August 8 2023. Unfortunately, the match ended in a loss, with Saki taking the fall. This prompted Konami to voice her frustrations, criticizing Saki for her weakness and questioning why someone like her, who contradicted the group's core values, was allowed to join God’s Eye. MIRAI, defending Saki, argued that she was growing stronger in her own way. This exchange eventually led to Konami challenging MIRAI for the Wonder of Stardom Championship on September 3 2023, with the match evolving into a battle over the philosophy and direction of God’s Eye.
</p>
<p>
    This was further explored during the press conference for the match. Konami expressed her belief that God’s Eye had devolved from a fighting faction built on becoming stronger into a comedic group who didn't take anything seriously. She emphasized her dedication to the God's Eye mantra by explaining the training she was undergoing in order for her to make a full time return to wrestling. Konami further declared that defeating MIRAI for the Wonder of Stardom Championship would mean that she had finally achieved the strength she had been striving for and would allow her to make her full time return.
</p>

    <span class="image-caption">MIRAI appeals for Konami to accept Saki Kashima into God's Eye</span>
</div>
<p>
    MIRAI, while sympathizing with Konami’s frustrations, argued that true strength also comes from supporting others and growing together as a unit. This philosophy was the opposite of what Konami has felt, which she first spoke about when she left Tokyo Cyber Squad in 2020 where she saw that wrestling and strength wasn’t built around friendship and relationships but instead was defined by results.
</p>
<p>
    On September 3, 2023, Konami and MIRAI finally faced off in a highly anticipated match, with MIRAI eventually emerging victorious. After the match, MIRAI once again appealed to Konami to accept Saki into God’s Eye, noting that Saki had chosen to support Konami in her corner during the bout. While Konami still disapproved of Saki’s place in the group, she reluctantly agreed to allow her to remain, on the condition that Saki would train and practice with the same dedication as the rest of them.
</p>
<p>
    From this point, Konami embarked on a world tour, competing in America and Europe to further her growth as a wrestler and enhance her skills. This tour included a hard-hitting match against her former junior from REINA, Masha Slamovich. Meanwhile, turmoil within Stardom led to significant changes within the roster culminating in the departure of several members, including God’s Eye's own MIRAI.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Overcoming Weakness: Embracing H.A.T.E.</h2>

</div>
<p>
    On April 16 2024, Konami announced her full time return to Stardom, with the goal of strengthening God’s Eye and capturing a title alongside the group. While building momentum with her stablemates, Konami once again found herself teaming with Saki Kashima. However, Saki, who had sustained an ankle injury, appeared to exaggerate its severity in an effort to avoid participating in matches. Undeterred, Konami consistently pushed Saki to step into the ring and fulfill her responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Konami’s first opportunity to claim a title for God’s Eye came on May 18 2024, when she teamed with Saki Kashima and Syuri in a trios gauntlet match to determine the number one contenders for the Artist of Stardom titles. Despite their collective efforts, they ultimately fell to Oedo Tai, who relied on underhanded tactics to secure the victory. Konami took the fall, a result that weighed heavily on her as she viewed it as a personal failure in her mission to strengthen God’s Eye, but also potentially highlighting a key weakness within her.
</p>
<div class="article-image left portrait" >
    <img src="/kvs2024/20240630.jpg" alt="Konami using a chair to help pick up the victory against FWC" width="100%;"/>
    <span class="image-caption">Konami using a chair to help pick up the victory against FWC</span>
</div>
<p>
    This didn’t stop their efforts, as Konami and Syuri would start building momentum together as a tag team to prove that they and God's Eye were the strongest force in Stardom, to the point where they would challenge Hazuki and Koguma for the Goddesses of Stardom titles. After throwing everything they had, Konami and Syuri were no closer to beating them which led to Konami resorting to her ways of old when she used a steel chair to help secure the win. To Konami, she felt that she couldn’t lose at any cost as she thought that she may never get this chance again to prove God’s Eye's strength.
</p>
<p>
    Following this, the next challenge for Konami and Syuri arose when they were set to defend the Goddesses of Stardom Championships against the Oedo Tai force of Thekla and Momo Watanabe. While Thekla and Momo recognized Syuri’s strength, they would dismiss Konami as not being worth their time. Despite this, Konami and Syuri would reiterate that they intended to break the defence record and become the new gatekeepers that the Stardom roster had to overcome.
</p>
<p>
    A rift however started to form between Konami and Syuri. Konami believed in winning by any means necessary, while Syuri insisted on fair competition, emphasizing the strength of their bond as master and student. Out of respect for her mentor, Konami reluctantly agreed to adhere to Syuri’s principles and fight fairly—a philosophy that she had previously rejected when she faced MIRAI in the previous year.
</p>
<p>
    During their title defence, Konami and Syuri faced intense pressure from Oedo Tai. Despite their best efforts, Konami once again turned to a weapon to shift the tide in their favor. Syuri intervened, stopping Konami from using the weapon and insisting they win fairly. For Konami, Syuri's moment of restraint likely symbolized the weakness she had long sought to overcome, as Syuri prioritized integrity over the results that Konami valued most. In a shocking betrayal, she turned on Syuri mid-match, allowing Momo and Thekla to capitalize and claim the Goddesses of Stardom titles.
</p>
<div class="article-image right landscape">
    <img src="/kvs2024/20240724_korakuen.jpg" alt="Konami berates Syuri and God's Eye after betraying them" width="100%" />
    <span class="image-caption">Konami berates Syuri and God's Eye after betraying them</span>
</div>
<p>
    After the match, Konami unleashed her frustrations on God’s Eye, doubling down on her belief that they were nothing more than a "comedy group" unworthy of her ambitions. Declaring this betrayal as a return to "her real self," she rejoined Oedo Tai, asserting that she had never truly left the faction. Adding to the sting of her betrayal, Konami harshly criticized Syuri, discarding her views of her as the wrestler she once aspired to emulate.
</p>
<p>
    Konami’s betrayal was not only a rejection of God’s Eye’s philosophy but also an admission of her own weakness. Unlike Syuri and the other members of God’s Eye, Konami lacked the spirit and willpower to persevere through adversity without compromise. Her vision of strength, rooted in achieving results, remained unfulfilled as she had yet to attain the success that the other members of God’s Eye had achieved over the years. In her pursuit of victory at all costs, Konami chose to abandon the ideals of resilience and honor that Syuri had taught her, resorting to underhanded tactics and cheating as the additional means to achieve the results she so desperately sought.
</p>
<p>
    Oedo Tai rebranded itself as H.A.T.E. after Natsuko Tora captured the World of Stardom Championship from Maika with assistance from her faction members and their newest recruit, Saya Kamitani. Declaring their ambition to dominate not just Stardom but the entire world of women’s wrestling, H.A.T.E. solidified its position as the main antagonistic force in the promotion.
</p>
<div class="article-image left portrait" >
    <img src="/kvs2024/20241207.jpg" alt="Konami standing over Syuri after challenging her to a match at Ryogoku Kokugikan" width="100%;"/>
    <span class="image-caption">Konami standing over Syuri after challenging her to a match at Ryogoku Kokugikan</span>
</div>
<p>
    Syuri, reflecting on the betrayal with <a href="https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/317995">Tokyo Sports</a>, acknowledged Konami’s decision to betray God's Eye and the path that she had chosen but expressed doubt about whether this would bring her the fulfilment she sought. Nonetheless, Syuri vowed to put an end to Konami and her new faction, H.A.T.E., as she could not forgive the betrayal of trust that shattered their bond.
</p>
<p>
    This development also triggered a change within God’s Eye, especially for Saki Kashima. While she retained her slacker tendencies, Saki began to take wrestling more seriously—though only really when facing H.A.T.E. This reflected her determination to prove that God’s Eye's faith in her over the past year was well-placed, and to ultimately challenge Konami’s dismissive view of the group.
</p>
<p>
    After months of intense back-and-forth between Konami and Syuri—including Konami sabotaging Syuri and Saki’s efforts to reclaim the Goddesses of Stardom Titles from Momo and Thekla, as well as thwarting their bid to reach the Goddess of Stardom Tag League finals—their rivalry reaches the next chapter on December 29 2024 at Ryogoku Kokugikan. The match, scheduled exactly three years after Konami’s departure from Stardom and Syuri’s ascent to the top, has become more than just their personal hatred for each other. It embodies a clash of philosophies on strength and serves as the ultimate test for Konami, who seeks to prove that she has finally surpassed the wrestler she once regarded as her master and "ideal wrestler."
