**You need Steam open as well as the game in your library.**

This is just a launcher that enables you to select between launching the game in a vanilla instance or a modded instance. This has
the mod bypass built as a DLL (source code of this can be found [here](https://github.com/GACastro95/AEW-FF-Mod-Bypass/tree/DLL)) so you no longer need to put any files in the game's binaries folder.

You can find the source code of the launcher itself [here](https://github.com/GACastro95/AEWFFLauncher)

<h5>First Time Setup</h5>

1. Launch the program
2. Navigate to the setup window
3. Set the folder to the root game directory of AEW Fight Forever, this is normally under /steamapps/common/AEWFightForever. If you have your modded version of the game installed seperately from the vanilla version you can set this here as well.
4. Launch the game either as a vanilla instance or a modded instance.
